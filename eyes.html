            Dior Backstage Eye Palette is the Dior makeup artists' secret weapon to create an array of pro eye looks, from the most natural to the most defined.
            Inspired by the energy backstage at the runway shows and makeup artist essentials, the Dior Backstage Eye Palette includes shades that suit all skin tones in buildable matte and iridescent textures for perfect eyes.

            Designed to be long-wearing yet richly pigmented, the Dior Backstage formulas are effortlessly buildable: initially neutral colors may be made bold and intense, depending on the desired color intensity.
            Their formulas reveal a second-skin finish.

            Dior Backstage Eye Palette contains:
            - An eye primer that reinforces the eyeshadows' hold and boosts their color.
            - Eight powders for use as eyeshadow or liner:
            three shimmer shades and three ultra-pigmented matte shades adorn the eyes, complemented by a highlighting hue and a sculpting shadow.
